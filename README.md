playing-with-arduino
====================

This is where I'll put code that I develop for Arduino. I'm only just starting out developing for 
Arduino but if you wish to copy something I commit then please feel free. I'd appreciate a mention if
you do but I'm doing this for pleasure of doing it not to make money or become famous. 

If you are interested I blog about my [electronics projects](http://mypilife.tumblr.com).
